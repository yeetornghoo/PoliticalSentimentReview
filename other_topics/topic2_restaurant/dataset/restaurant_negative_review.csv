"Branch Senawang. The waiting time is ok. Food and drinks are ok but a little bit more variety again ok. Parking problem because the limited bit. Ambience is ok. Just be more FLUENT mengorder procedure. Now this customer select the menu near the counter, waiting in line so long that terhegeh-hegeh next customer. A family many who lined up since then just about to ask each what they eat. I proposed park near each table menu. Place order kopitiam style sheet like that. Ask waiter to fill customer orders InForm sheet, then just go pay close counters"

"Cashier taking order at Subang Empire Gallery, on 3rd February 2014 at 1pm, Mr Prakash is VERY unfriendly. Took orders from few of my friends as well. Same attitude. Somewhat ruin our holiday morning mood."
"The worst meal experience ever in my life!
Egg benetic is so salty and sour!
The mushroom soup comes with free real human long hair!Anyway, the chef is the key person who contribute us such a ""terrific"" experience, improvement need to be made!"
"Dear family & friends, my husband & I patronised Delicious on his birthday. I ordered baked beans, clearly marked as vegetarian on the menu. Halfway through the meal he discovered meat in the baked beans. On questioning the manager, we found out that the baked beans was prepared with beef stock & beef bacon. When we asked who the chef was, we were told that these items were prepared in the main kitchen and were sent out to all their restaurants in Klang Valley. We were shocked & deeply disappointed as this is a favourite restaurant & we have been there in good faith. We wrote an official complaint. It has been a week & we haven't heard from them. Please inform all your Hindus, Buddhists,vegetarians & people who don't consume beef of this & ask them not to patronise this chain of restaurants. We have escalated this to the consumer association. Thank you"

"Today at approximately 1400hrs at Sunway Pyramid branch, a RAT jumped out of the kitchen and towards the customers. People were screaming and yelling yet NONE of the staff gave a F*&K about it. Not even the manager. Just like how you don't give a F&*K about your customers giving feedbacks on this page"
"Yesterday we have gone to IOI seoul garden. let to say it was not my first time to go there and I have been there for few times. I want to share some experience with you guys. First they increase the prices , now it is 50 RM per person (After tax, service), then the service was very bad , for example when the limon finished I asked them to re-fill they said sorry finished! Also their shrimps same as their crab was to smelly and bad taste after grilling. I told to manager at least for today (I don't know about other days) I think your seafoods are not fresh and smelly , he answered , Oo I will check and then he didn't do any thing. Don't go"
slow service and not customer friendly .... should be a fight night terok

"Terrible customer service at your Aeon kinta city mall, Ipoh outlet!!!! I am a regular Starbucks customer, so wanted to give coffee bean a try and so went to the counter asking that girl to recommend me what is nice to drink. Then she suggested some newly launch flavor which I'm not convinced. So I politely asked for another. She then suggested again. Then again I turned it down. She then responded rudely to me by yelling out loud that if I don't trust her, what for to ask for her suggestion at first. Then she laugh loudly at me just like I am begging her for that drink! Not only her, the other crew there were laughing out loud as well! I then asked her for her name card but she just ignored me. What type of customer service is this? Where is our consumer right?! I really hope to get a proper explanation as well as apologize from that particular coffee bean outlet! This is totally a disgrace to Coffee Bean Malaysia!!!"
"If a staff member deems it acceptable to hold your stale piece of cake hostage until you get 5 measly sen from your bag, there is something very wrong with the hiring and training processes"
I would like to lodge a complaint at your outlet in Kinta City Mall Ipoh. The customer service is very rude and not friendly at all!!! I went to that branch today (24-1-2014) and the crew girl at the counter scolded us and then laugh at us loud in front of all the crews and other customers simply because we took too long time to think what to drink and wasted the girl too much of saliva and energy to serve us! What type of customer service is this? This made me feel like being humiliated and insulted!! I demand a proper apology from the management of that particular coffee bean Malaysia branch (Aeon Kinta City Ipoh). I hope Coffee Bean Malaysia take this issue serious as it would greatly affect the reputation of the company in Malaysia.
"i would like to complaint on your outlet at aeon station 18 ipoh. caramel ice blended too sweet until cant drink. hazelnut ice blended, i totally cant taste any sweet. both too liquid. what i want is ice blended, not ice coffee. pls check it out is there any new workers (indian woman) on 17/12. if yes, pls well trained"
Was at CBTL Gurney Plaza and services was bad...had to wait 30min for 'the brew of the day' when I was told by the staff it'll only take 10mins. Even than I had to go in and remind them of my order!!! Very poor services and messy....
I wish to highlight that the quality of the recent traveler lid for hot drink. It actually release some kind of 'plastic' taste to my latte & hot vanilla. Please look into it.
Food isn't nice…
"Service is good but quality of the food is terribly disappointing. Even a simple salad is chewy, stalky and heavy handed with the dressing. The roots were still attached to the stems! Desserts are so so. "
food is great but poor customer service..
Gosh! The Bladdy management got some serious task in hand!The waiter and waitresses are very very very ineffective. A CUP OF EARL GREY TOOK AN HOUR TO SERVE!
"The food is lousy and the service is very bad, its as though the waiters are not paid! Waited long for the bill and 20minutes for my change!!"

Good food and service but charging RM1 for plain water is super lame. Waiter did not even highlight the charge when we ordered other drinks as well.
Food was great but sadly service was really bad. We went to break our fast and one of my friends had to wait for a whole TWO hours for her food to come and it was actually the best (Spicy Salmon Naan Pizza) out of everything we had ordered. The waitress had also mixed up our orders and charged us for items we did not even have. Hope this will be improved.
"Servis not good, food poor prepared. Waste my time going there."
"A very disappointing experience for me at pavilion branch, the food were served in cold and very oily. I have made a complaint on the spot but the staff just smile at us and give no response. It is ridiculous!"
"I'm at the Ampang Park branch now. The worst watered down soup I've ever had. Food is cold and burnt. Grilled fish looks like wet socks and on top of all that, it's not cheap. Stop serving sucky overpriced food. Now I remember why I stopped eating at this joint. So sad considering just a few years ago, you guys served really good seafood!"
Terrible service and terrible staff attitude. Not coming here ever again
"A big NO for manhattan fish market at Sogo! Useless service, ignorant manager and tasteless food. Did not even get our complete order despite reminding the staff several times. Will definitely not come back here anymore and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else."
"Totally disappointed with the food served in Sunway Carnival Butterworth, Penang. Ordered Scallop Americana but the chef put too much black pepper, it tastes spicier than super hot curry! Lips and tongue were burning! Paying money to torture myself! Informed the Manager but she didn't pass the message to the chef. What's the point then??? No improvement at all!!! Highly NOT recommended! Eat at your own risk!"
"Service at Setia City Mall sucks. Almost an hour just to get our platter (one set only, so slow). Not recommended. Boo yahhhhh"
food is fine. the problem is the waiter's attitude. no manners.
"The food was nice and delicious, but the service at Johor KSL was too slow, we wait around 2 hours to had our platter. Service was worse."

Horrible horrible service. I am at the branch in Pavillion. My dish was cold and the waiters cant understand English. Most were rude except one who is quite polite.
"Most of the time, the food is cold when they served. Experienced in Gurney Plaza"
"Hopefully, plates and plastic glasses used could be changed in accordance with the tax imposed on the customer as well as glass tableware adopted not look right now like no star tomyam shop please .. let's worth the tax imposed .."
