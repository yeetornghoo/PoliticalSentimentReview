BEST SERVICE AND GIVING BIG IMPACT TO THE SOCIETY 
"Best gourmet burger so far. I am also a big fan of how they do their business, as well as being very willing to help out with social causes. Myburgerlab is awesome"
"The great burgers is a given but what keeps customers coming back is the overall experience from the friendly and efficient service from the Geeks (who take pride in working there), the restaurant atmosphere, the initiative to keep fans involved to constantly being interactive and attentive to customers' inquires, praises and complains on social media. Keep up the great work and standards "

The best chicken rice in town. The blended chili sauce is a must try
Arguably one of THE Best Cheese Naan in Malaysia!! They are quite generous with the Cheese & the tenderness of the Naan is heavenly!! And the Dhaal is the BEST Dhaal I've ever tasted. The Nasi Bryani is quite good too. You should also try the Masala Chicken. It's a winner!!
