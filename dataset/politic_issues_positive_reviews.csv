It was sarcasm or cynicism .. read it up and comprehended the implied intent tun .. salute!
Most pengomen here do not understand the meaning conveyed by X. X is a cynical view on the merits and RAM Holdings so they fired a study in depth before making a decision and the indigenous community will also need to be aware of with this insinuation that the results of the study merit and RAM Holdings can ditepis and proved more successful with the indigenous community.
"Can not afford a tank does not mean that can not afford to contribute to the well-being of the country. Approach each may be different, but the goal remains the same ... Regards One Malaysia."
X THE GREAT ... but the sentiment is blocked by their own leaders ...
"Take It kata2 X is a rod move towards progress. 
Indigenous people live comfortably right now ... It works good, good work .. our private dining in our je ... private kat ... even educated pounds ... how we're going to rank higher than other races. We will not pay higher than other races. No matter how much effort we ... will not match their efforts. As far as we stepped forward .. do not be comparable to measures ... we despised them ... and will do so ... I have to smile to say anything ... "
At first reading feeling very angry. But when the survey may be some truth behind from a corner. From a different angle. I think the writing and research conducted by the Chinese-Chinese bias slightly. I admit that poor quality Bumiputera contractors. The reason is not good but I do not have the opportunity.
Only I can say we work harder and stay as one sure we be rich..... as we got resources. ..compare to others. .. thays why we lose if we compare races... as a proud malaysian pls be united
"Faiz Juanpablo Morelaz just bcuz we dare to demand so we can get what is best 4 us all races can do that too just a matter u want or dont want to that all; since our country practice DEMOCRATIC why the rakyat cant demand for the best for them, we can always demand bcuz we rakyat choose the goverment so we have rights to.demand ...like our parents they always want the best for us... now is not a matter of race but the matter of QUALITY..."
"Indeed, the issue of racism irrelevant which side though ... justice should not be translated as an equal"
Certainly not relevanBahasa Malay racism MMG beautiful .. understand it from various angles to the benefit of all unutk now and the future .. people like Tun hardhead will not waste time to comment that there is no benefit unless things to see positive changes in society. .. wake up everybody ... love Malaysia Tun .. n we all party anywhere ... justice should not be translated as an equal
Take it positively .... then ... so was bumiputera who berkualiti for the good of ourselves and generations too .. end of story ... a lot was self muhasabah
I don't judge and I don't care because human behaviour we can't control. If malaysia going to die what can I do. If someone in malaysia become rich why I have to be jealous. What I know is develop myself and never give up to be successful.
Tun articles very meaningful and less cynical and not to specific groups and also very reasonable!
"Tersurat or tersirat I don't care. But I realize it is true both ways. This statement will definitely make me a better person. Siapa yang terasa tu I hope u move on and be a better ""Malaysian"" if that is what you claim to be lah."
"Quality rather than non-indigenous, but in the private world of communication and language is in Bahasa Inggeris which is the biggest drawback of the indigenous people. Je admit was mostly Malays difficult to speaking. Not smooth like the other nations. When the communication process is not running smoothly, disputes arise, Most malays difficult to protect yourself when to argue in Bahasa Inggeris. Communicate any non earth pulak proficient in Bahasa Inggeris diorang distortions conditions. The so victims are indigenous. I tgk ni from my own experience. Sometimes non sgt ground this is not great, but good cover themselves pressed between two fingers."
"Do not curl up insults if the firmware, more dignified if we make the teaching and learning correct the deficiency."
"Let the Malays, we prove the words - words of SERI & RAM also from Tun sheer lie. How do I prove this? Make us are the guys with the quality, just said - just said just now lie"
Recalling how the value and quality of the natives? there should be a plan of action .. selesaikn internal and external issues and began training to its core operations has sustained quality
Terbaik.Kita not need people who do not berkualiti.Meruntuh and impair the country.
Sharp and earthy as usual. I also have a clause arguing this issue featured an article on the pro-opposition portal The Malaysian Insider a few weeks ago.
Thumps up berzaman tun ... a source of inspiration ....
Best. Verse layered eat. Before puak2 merit comment please understand in advance
"So the deserving, the ones who work hard, whose achievement are achieved by merit instead or kuota is not good. On the otherhand, awarding things and titles and money and contracts etc etc to people because they're of a certain race is good? Is that it, cause I'm confused."
It will be the turn for confession and talk Tun degrade indigenous people themselves. I think the spin and charge for this may be his weak IQ between sarcasm and do not understand the true reality of the best .. Tun ..
The truth of it is there. But from another viewpoint should also be taken into account. . Non-profits simply hopes for the country but also the welfare of the people whatsoever. . Some natives did not die in his own country. .
"Bitter Truth. They complain of inequality, yet 'they' are the ones who are biased!"
"Agree. View Tun not follow emotional but reality. If Malaysia is to progress; If employers want advanced indigenous; do the hard work, striving to attain the required quality."
Every time we tend to blame the failure of non-indigenous earth why? Why is there a much diperantauan can succeed and compete with foreigners? The root we are too dependent on the government ... if we do not we shall succeed dependencies ...
also have to study the quality ... there are still those who rely on crutches .. that depends on God and knowledge available.
"thank and congratulate Tun ..... but very sad because there are also Malays Tun read reviews but I do not understand - but there are also Malays who this insane, .. continue to insult their own race - sedih.Kalau is not the Malays who administer this country, our country is so long already so highly developed as Singapore but already removed the Malays."
"This issue is not exclusive to one particular race, the other races also need to buck up and realise that meritocracy is the way forward and that only the best will survive when stakes are high !"
they mostly just want profit .. no matter their race indigenous to or else the same .. aje ...
bangun Bumiputera .. dont hanya berasa selesa untuk apa yang kita ada sekarang ... tiada kesakitan tiada keuntungan .. Allah TIDAK Akan merubah Nasib Sesuatu Kaum melainkan dia Sendiri mengusahakannya .. buang semua sikap negatif seperti rasuah .. maksiat dan segala sesuatu yang Allah memberitahu kita untuk mengelakkan ... insya Allah Selamat Dunia dan akhirat ...
That's true .. Even my Tun ni da young but I look and value sndiri how native and non-native. Differed greatly!
Nicely said tun ..! Many implicit in order tun ni .. To all earth's we should wake up from keep occupied in silence ..!! help the earth's to help our country
"Tun said sarcastically so cynical. Fathers who give reasons meritocracy forget that their fathers had always given a stick by another dah kingdom. Stick in the form of lesen perlombongan, lesen wine and gambling, lesen rice and sugar and more lesen-lesen monopoly to create money and possessions can be as high as a mountain. Fathers-fathers is now arrogant and first son bumiputera fault. It was just their excuse to continue to hold economic power. That is, they still insisted that the kingdom should be inclusive to their fathers. Inclusive what more if they themselves like to exclude the Malay / bumiputera?"
"Man is arrogant, presumptuous and takabbur. He brings sustenance to all mankind regardless of merit. Water, air, oxygen, etc. are provided free life."
Open mind is his own mind. Non-compete earth strong as the healthy way. Earth over the jealousy if other earth did they do to rise up when should be helped in every way. Is it here that helped tu do not feel the need to forget myself.
Good .. verses aloud .. it is fitting that there is at all certain bumiputra bumiputra .. melatah too fast and bouncy ..
only the quantity of quality bukanye diutamakn
warning at the nation itself .. muhasabah self ..
"Gratitude dah we are still capable teamed pemikir2 experience and knowledge. EXHAUST TAKE clear cloudy water. There is still room and time for each than we THINK and CHANGE towards a more berkualiti life. Educate yourself OPEN minded, urbane TEAMWORK so that we can foster qualities that can INCREASE IN THE FIELDS EVERYWHERE WE CEBURI."
 There are always have pros n cons.. cooperation is important.. once egoism appeared.. open the door. Gather together n have a meeting.. communication important.
No need lah menunding finger on the weakness of our own ... we showed our weakness in the post-post ... we solve the problem yourself weaknesses before moving to the next degree
Tun is wrong in his views. There are alot of malays who are smart and most of them are in the buisness sectors and not those who are getting solid govt contracts because they are cronies! Maybe Tun is referring to his own son which the govt bailout when his company was in trouble!
On earth Mahathir quality is just her child. When the economic downturn earth fault when a full family meal and earth property piracy
