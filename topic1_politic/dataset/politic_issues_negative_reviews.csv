This is not condemned .. his name right sarcasm .. please read properly and understand the meaning of the lines
For who do not understand .. This time Tun paper is a sharp satire more spicy!
Surrogate. I do not support any. But rightly what Tun convey. I work with the Malays already have a name .. any pretender to convey his own people in different bodohkan .. with non melayu.ya rightly they use our services. But despite that they taught us .. I have to deal with the government until today. It terok. I'm not cursing the government completely. But in their unconscious. My own mother is a government job. But he taught us how to be like other people .. not use assistance or cable is .. somehow people can think themselves. I want to know Kee??
Malays forget easily. wither as a political macai.
There's a touch question not afford to buy a home because of small salaries. Malays are drifting in this game. The enforcement engrossed corrupt. When wages go up prices go up .. it was his game. Malay to any single wage earner will not achieve the same level of average wage earners .. why not do effective work. Engrossed corrupt. They do not taste bitter like his other Malay wage earners. Merokrasi reason. Puiihh!

"he is so rich, yet he still have nothing nice to say about its own race and the religion of his own race believe in. Allah s.w.t please show us the hidayah of the true strength of how in directly how the bumiputras have help the mother earth we have live in."

 He is not a real malay...the malay can compete. During his time they were fed with corrupt so that they won't be bothered to work hard. Not easy to revert back.
"Tun derogatory greatest verse .. (verse can not blah) .. I understand Tun certain groups do not want to say too arrogant .. say only the only who has made Malaysia prosper with abundance of wealth .. that's the only wise and clever to underestimate other people ..!! but the real truth is peace attained prosperity and wealth is the result of tolerance and sacrifice other people who are trying to deny them ..

"The only reason alone ... know china chinese chinese they will stay close to the project even though their Chinese member shithead and he more expensive than Malay ... the secret of every penny they spend, if possible, do not miss the other nations of the chinese .. ."
"Private meritocracy? Puihh! China ignorant rank boss did not wear excel reti day-to-day contact with maki with the non-Malay manager again Want sembang merit. Puihh! Tu was defended again. Gred oversea whereas just last sem new twinning program traces his deep oversea. Puppet powerful smart la. People we partitioned, in contain a."
I can smell the stench of his sarcasm even more than the stench of his hypocrisy.
Tun had indeed killed sarcasm!

"same as the aristocratic leader who can not do the job, but the opportunity to sit in the supreme council."
"Chinese in Malaysia are Chinese nation's most self-conscious and not ungrateful .. british granny tok bring empty in here for work, duly delivered piping should return all the land to the people of china china ni ... dah given a clever populist now argue Miscellaneous sense if the nation .. very nice china not earned sitting in malaysia .. go find another place for one's own country ... the taste is very good ... people lost respect dah kat Malay Chinese nation is now even more after the Pru over 13 .."

"Do not believe sitting near the chinese words that, already their policy like that, for want thighs calves over dutch pulak. Whom teach Malay to bribery and corruption, cina.benglah, greedy policy."
Many Malays are reliable immersed in the political mainstream workplace. Who can not bodek but very discreet rarely get promoted and valued
I used to buy Chinese goods stores want price negotiable. last he said you want you lift you do not want you to go find another shop. was rude
"Many corporate employees not know the rank of pounds for work, have a good fan."

"The government is not bekualiti results from people who are not qualified .. And the government has no quality will produce people with no quality .."" ""instances of a leader is the people themselves"" ""if corrupt people will be the leaders of corruption resulting"
"not trying to bring down their own people, as long as there is corruption, as long as we the status quo .."
"natives are not quality, if scopes on government employees, there is a lot of truth. Leadership department thinking more status and rank of service to the people .... on whom they regularly deal with this in the context of the supplier will see this shortfall."
